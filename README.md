### Getting Started

# Tutorial: Forking and Managing a Repository with GitHub Desktop

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to fork a repository on GitHub and manage the forked repository using GitHub Desktop. Whether you're contributing to an open-source project or collaborating on a team assignment, these skills will enable you to work effectively with code on GitHub.

## Part 1: Forking a Repository on GitHub

Forking a repository creates your own copy of another user's repository, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project.

## Steps to Fork a Repository:

1. **Log into GitHub**: Ensure you're logged into your GitHub account.
2. **Find the Repository**: Navigate to the repository you want to fork.
3. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button located at the top right of the repository page. GitHub will then create a copy of the repository in your account.

## Part 2: Cloning and Managing Your Fork with GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop allows you to clone repositories to your local machine, make changes, and easily sync those changes back to GitHub.

## Cloning Your Fork:

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**: Start the GitHub Desktop application on your computer.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Go to `File` > `Clone Repository`.
    - In the clone dialog, switch to the "URL" tab.
    - Locate your forked repository under your GitHub account or manually enter the URL of the forked repository.
    - Choose a local path for the repository and click `Clone`.

## Making Changes and Contributing Back:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch by clicking `Current Branch` > `New Branch`. Name it appropriately based on the changes you intend to make.
2. **Edit and Save Your Changes**: Use your preferred code editor to make changes to the project. Save your changes.
3. **Commit and Push Changes**:
    - In GitHub Desktop, review your changes. Write a commit message describing your updates and commit to your branch.
    - Push your changes to GitHub by clicking `Push origin`.

## Proposing Changes with a Pull Request:

1. **Navigate to the Original Repository**: On GitHub, go to the original repository you forked from.
2. **Open a Pull Request**:
    - You might see a prompt to "Compare & pull request" for your branch. Click it.
    - Describe your changes in the pull request form and submit it.

The project maintainers can now review your contribution and decide to merge it, request changes, or provide feedback.

# Conclusion

Forking and managing repositories with GitHub Desktop are essential skills for collaborative software development. This tutorial should help you start contributing to projects and collaborating with others more effectively.
